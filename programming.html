            <h1 class="ubr"><b><u>How to start learning programming</u></b></h1>
            <h2 class="abc"><U><b>Pick a language</b></U></h2>
            <br>
            <p>If you are a beginner in programming, learning a new language or a new framework is essential. As a fresher in the field of programming language, make sure that you remain steady in both learning and coding. However, it can be daunting and confusing for you to choose the best one out of a pool of hundreds of programming languages out there.

                Here are the top 7 programming languages that you can hang in 2021 and learn them to improve your coding skills:<br><b>1- JavaScript</b><br>
                JavaScript is the most used programming language in the world. Even famous social media platforms such as Facebook, Google, or YouTube, use JavaScript in their infrastructure. JavaScript is famous for its various frameworks, such as Node.js, and you get a language capable of server-side scripting too. Not only this, with the use of JavaScript, one can also build full-scale games in an external game engine or the browser using JavaScript. JavaScript is mainly used for Front-end and back-end web development, mobile apps and developing games<br>
            <br> <b>2- Python</b><br>
            The ever-growing importance of data in business has resulted in a quick rise in popularity and demand for Python. Python is used in server-side development, web and mobile app development to building machine learning software, there's nothing Python can't do. Also, this programming language has a vast collection of libraries, tools, and frameworks that make it a must in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.<br>
            <b>3- Go</b><br>
            Go is a short form of Golang, and the tech giant Google developed it in 2007 as an alternative to languages like Java, C, and C++. Projects like Kubernetes, Docker, and Blockchain use Go to support multi-threading and concurrent running of processes effortlessly. For beginners, Go is one of the best programming languages to learn in 2021 because of its features such as simplicity, speed, dynamism, and rising popularity. Also, Go is lightweight and excellent for writing network applications. Go is mainly used for graphics, machine learning, mobile applications, network and system programming<br>
            <b>4- Java</b><br>
            If we talk about Java as a programming language, this is one of the oldest object-oriented programming languages. It is still one of the most popular and highly sought-after. It holds the #2 rank in the PYPL popularity index in June 2021. Java as a programming language is omnipresent in web, Android apps, banking and finance software, desktop, and so on<br>
            <b>5- Kotlin</b><br>
            We cannot deny the fact that Android is the highest-selling and most used operating system globally and Google has declared Kotlin as the primary language for Android development. Hence, for those who want to jump into Android development, the best programming language is Kotlin. This is a cross-platform general-purpose coding language that gives you full interoperability with Java<br>
            <b>6- PHP</b><br>
            Tech giants such as Yahoo, Wikipedia, and Facebook value the PHP programming language. PHPs syntax is very clear and easy to learn and almost 80% of all websites use PHP. On the other hand PHP offers many powerful frameworks such as Laravel, making your life even easier. Moreover, PHP is compatible with all prominent databases, packs a punch with loads of automation tools for deploying and testing your applications. PHP is mainly used for backend web development and server-side scripting<br>
            <b>7- C#</b><br>
            C# is commonly known as “C sharp”. This was built by Microsoft and inspired by the C programming language. However, C# is way more advanced than the C programming language. Also, it is dynamic and fully integrated with the .NET framework. C# is loved by most developers as it is used for making 2D and 3D games using the Unity gaming engine. Not only this, it is prevalent for desktop and mobile app development, too. C# holds 4th position in the PYPL popularity index at this moment, the demand and growth of C# as a programming language is certainly going to scale with time</p>
            <h2 class="abc"><u><b>use online platforms(W3school,youtube,etc...)</b></u></h2>
            <br>
            <p>One of the best website to learn how to programme is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3school</a><br>
            you could also use YOUTUBE to find free website that teach you programming easily and whith different languages.</p>
            <h2 class="abc"><u><b>learn the fundamentals</b></u></h2>
            <p>learningthe basics of programming is gonna make things easier for you.<br>
                Just like human languages, programming languages also follow grammar called syntax. There are certain basic program code elements which are common for all the programming languages.

                Most important basic elements for programming languages are:
                
                Programming Environment,
                Data Types,
                Variables,
                Keywords,
                Logical and Arithmetical Operators,
                If else conditions,
                Loops,
                Numbers, Characters and Arrays,
                Functions and
                Input and Output Operations .</p>
            <h2 class="abc"><u><b>learn about "OOP Concepts"</b></u></h2>
            <P>Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPs) is a programming concept that works on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. ... The basic concept of OOPs is to create objects, re-use them throughout the program, and manipulate these objects to get results.</P>
            <h2 class="abc"><u><b>learn about Data Structures</b></u></h2>
            <P>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
                <BR>Data Structures are necessary for designing efficient algorithms. It provides reusability and abstraction . Using appropriate data structure, can help programmers save a good amount of time while performing operations such as storage, retrieval or processing of data. Manipulation of large amounts of data is easier.
            </P>
            <h2 class="abc"><u><b>learn about Data management</b></u></h2>
            <P>Data management is the practice of collecting, keeping, and using data securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively. ... Managing digital data in an organization involves a broad range of tasks, policies, procedures, and practices.</P>
            <h2 class="abc"><u><b>do a project</b></u></h2>
